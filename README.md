# Advent of Code â€“ Solutions

![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/112706767/160be980-3b1a-11eb-9dbe-439a40adfa99)

I enjoy solving the great [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges every year.
I usually solve them in pure Python although I often resort to NumPy.
Some problems have several solutions since I find it interesting analyzing the trade-offs of different approaches and/or exploring alternative datastructures and algorithms.

To run my solutions you'll need to install the great [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) package (`pip install advent-of-code-data`).
